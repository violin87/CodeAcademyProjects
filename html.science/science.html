    The evolution of animals began over 600 million years ago. The organism that existed then, may not exist in the present time and probably do not resemble any living creature today. From that time, animals have evolved in a highly diverse kingdoms. Researchers have identified over one million species that exist on Earth. Animals vary in complexity as they exist in a form of a simple to most complex being. Scientists face difficulties in classifying them in a group. They should point out the traits, common to all creatures, and the traits that can discriminate the dissimilarities among interconnected groups of organisms. The classification system differentiates the animals as per their superficial structure, morphology, evolutionary data, development at the embryo stage, and genetic features. It is a continuous process as the new species discovery is actively going on. It also helps to understand the procedure of conservation of the diversity of life on the Earth.

    The five most well known classes of vertebrates (animals with backbones) are mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians. There are also a lot of animals without backbones. These are called invertebrates. Two of the most commonly known classes are arachnids (spiders) and insects.
