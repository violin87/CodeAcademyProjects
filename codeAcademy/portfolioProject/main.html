<h2> About Me</h2>

  <main class = 'mainInfo'>
   <p class = 'info'>
    I am a new programmer. I finished a Bootcamp a year ago. After a couple of rough months, I participated in several projects and started creating my LinkedIn portfolio. I hope to build up my resume and start working as a part-time software engineer.

    My original background is in classical music, but I decided to change my life and become a professional programmer. My Bootcamp focused on Full-Stack development, giving me experience with both front-end and back-end technologies.
    
    My projects include a calculator I built for my daughter, and I am currently working on a scheduling app for a friend. I am also preparing for several job interviews, hoping to take the next step in my career as a developer.

    My projects include a calculator for my daughter, designed to make learning numbers fun and interactive. Currently, I am working on a scheduling app for my friend, focusing on efficient time management and real-time updates. I am also actively preparing for several job interviews as I take the next step in my software engineering career.
